Approximately 8% of global carbon emissions come from tourism. However, most people have no way of knowing how much carbon they emit while traveling.To address this issue, we have planned an eco-friendly travel recommendation platform called **Ecovel**.

While previous services were merely about providing information, Ecovel focuses on actively encouraging user participation.

## ðŸŒ¿ Key Features

1. **Login & Profile Registration**  
   - Register your profile picture using a CNN-based facial recognition AI.

2. **Eco-Friendly Travel Route Recommendation** ðŸ§  *(Powered by Gemini)*  
   - Get personalized eco-conscious travel routes based on your input.

3. **Photo Missions** ðŸ§  *(Gemini used for landmark recognition)*  
   - Upload a selfie taken at the target location.  
   - Gemini is used to verify whether the background matches the expected landmark.

4. **Carbon Reduction Report**  
   - Visualize your carbon savings compared to traditional travel options.

5. **Growth Log & Daily Eco Quiz** ðŸ§  *(Gemini-generated quizzes)*  
   - Take daily environment-themed true/false quizzes generated by Gemini.


  ## ðŸ¤– Gemini Integration

This project actively integrates **Google's Gemini API** to enhance both user experience and system intelligence. We used Gemini in the following core features:

| Feature | Gemini's Role | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Daily Eco Quiz** | Automatically generates true/false quizzes on environmental topics | Keeps users engaged with fresh daily content |
| **Eco-Friendly Route Recommendation** | Generates personalized travel routes based on user input | Delivers context-aware, sustainable route suggestions |
| **Mission Photo Validation** | Analyzes uploaded images to verify if the target landmark is present in the background | Ensures authenticity through visual verification |

> All three features rely on **Google Gemini's capabilities in both text generation and image understanding**, providing a highly scalable and intelligent eco-travel service.
